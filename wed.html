<p style="color:black;">

Women’s Entrepreneurship Day (WED) is a day on which the work of WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS is observed, discussed, and celebrated, held on the nineteenth of November of each year.<br>
The inaugural event in 2014 was held in New York City at the United Nations, with additional events being held simultaneously in several other countries. 144 nations overall recognized the first WED, which included the presentation of the Women’s Entrepreneurship Day Pioneer Awards. The organization behind W.E.D. also has an ambassadorship and fellowship program

<p><b style="font-size:23px;color:black;">WHO TOOK THIS INITIATIVE? </b></p>

<img src="blog_images/w2.png" class="full" alt=""/>
<p style="color:black;">W.E.D. NGO was founded by Wendy Diamond after volunteering with the Adelante Foundation, which provides microcredit to low income women, while in Honduras. Upon her return to the US, she decided she wanted to develop something to help this and similar philanthropic causes. The first WED was held on November 19, 2014, and was observed in 144 countries that year.

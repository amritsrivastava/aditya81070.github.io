United Nations Information Centres (UNICs) are the principal sources of information about the United Nations system in the countries, where they are located. UNICs are responsible for promoting greater public understanding and support for the aims and activities of the United Nations by disseminating information on the work of the Organization to people all around.

The first two UNICs were established in 1946. At present, there are 63 Information Centres, Services and Offices worldwide.<br>

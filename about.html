## WhoamI

<p>I'm a grad pursuing CSE @JECRC foundation Jaipur,India. I love to code,listening music and dream to travel a lot.</p>I recently started to work on Python. I know enough about basic programming languages like C/C++. One thing that always encourage me to go forward is, <b><i>Artificial Intelligence</i></b>. I am also an open-source contributor at <b>fossasia.</b>
<p>You can view my resume <a href="aditya81070.github.io/resume.pdf" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>I am a little introvert though, I like interacting with strangers. I love to keep myself updated to new technologies and share, discuss my views with others on programming stuff. I admire movies of action and science-friction genre.</p>
